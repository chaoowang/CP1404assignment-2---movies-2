# CP1404 Assignment 2 - Movies to Watch 2.0 by Chao-Hsuan Wang

A Python project with GUI and Console programs that (re)use classes to manage a list of *Movies to Watch*.


# Project Reflection

## 1. How long did the entire project (assignment 2) take you?
 About 9.5 hours in total, the MovieCollection class took the longest time.
Note: You may like to use the WakaTime plugin, which tracks exactly how long you spend in code. 
See http://wakatime.com (but note that the free version only has a 7-day history)

## 2. What are you most satisfied with?
The kivy app. 
It worked well in the development process and I got a sense of achievement when finishing it.

## 3. What are you least satisfied with?
The MovieCollection class.
It took me a long time, and I feel frustration when error occur again and again.

## 4. What worked well in your development process?
The kivy app

## 5. What about your process could be improved the next time you do a project like this?
I'll break down the project in small tasks before start doing it. 

## 6. Describe what learning resources you used and how you used them.
Lecture slides. I look back the lecture slides when I faced problem.

## 7. Describe the main challenges or obstacles you faced and how you overcame them.
The main challenge are the MovieCollection class.
I'm not that familiar writing the class, so it took me a long time to finish it.
When faced problem, I look back the lecture slides 12(More on Classes).
Besides the MovieCollection class, I faced a problem when run the program again.
When I run the program twice, I didn't get the output expected the second time (the watch/unwatch status was not same as the csv file).
To solve the problem, I run the program multiple times with different input to find out which part went wrong.


## 8. Briefly describe your experience using classes and if/how they improved your code.
It took me quite a time to write the class. However, using the class make the code easier to write. 
Compare to assignment1, a1_classes.py got less lines (but with more comments).
Besides, the code is more easier to read, and it's also easier to fix when error occurred.
